An Efficient Solution can solve the problem in O(n) time and O(1) space. The idea is to use Sliding Window for the given array.

Let us use a window covering from index wL to index wR. Let the number of zeros inside the window be zeroCount. We maintain the window with at most m zeros inside.

The main steps are: 

While zeroCount is no more than m: expand the window to the right (wR++) and update the count zeroCount. 
While zeroCount exceeds m, shrink the window from left (wL++), update zeroCount; 
Update the widest window along the way. The positions of output zeros are inside the best window.
